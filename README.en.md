## Overview

AiCode is a universal AI coding agent that runs on Android, packing a full Linux development environment into your phone: it bundles an Alpine Linux container and terminal, and the AI agent can read and write files, run shell commands and run build tools, so writing, debugging and building all happen on-device. A remote SSH server can also serve as the execution backend, turning your phone into a mobile workstation for remote projects.

There is nothing to set up beforehand: install the app, configure a model under AI Vendors, and you can start coding — no computer, no environment to build yourself. AiCode ships no models and locks you into no vendor: it supports the OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini protocols plus custom providers, with models, keys and endpoints all configured by you.

## Features

### AI Agent

- **AI Agent** — Built-in tools for file read/write/edit, shell execution, background terminal, code & web search, image recognition, todo lists, and more; streaming output with live Markdown rendering and automatic context compression
- **Built-in browser** — A multi-tab WebView browser the AI can drive to navigate, click, fill forms and take screenshots to complete web tasks; supports night mode and local file previews
- **Parallel subagents** — Spawn subagents with their own isolated context to research, review or compare approaches in the background without blocking the current chat; a read-only **Explore** subagent is built in, and you can define your own with a custom model, tool set and prompt
- **Three run modes** — BUILD for normal development, PLAN for read-only planning (writes blocked at the tool layer), AUTO to approve everything without prompts — pick the permission scope you trust
- **Checkpoints & Undo** — Snapshots are recorded before the agent edits code; one-tap rollback of code, chat history, or both
- **Skills & Auto Memory** — Global/project-level skills and long-term memory let the AI reuse experience and project conventions across sessions
- **MCP Protocol** — Connect to local (stdio) or remote (HTTP) MCP servers to dynamically extend AI tool capabilities
- **Tool permissions & custom prompts** — Per-tool authorization rules; system prompts can be overridden by the user and survive app upgrades

### Models & Providers

- **Model-agnostic** — No bundled models and no vendor lock-in: models, keys and endpoints are yours to configure
- **Protocol support** — Compatible with the OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini protocols, with presets for several official providers and support for custom ones; model lists and pricing are customizable
- **Multiple keys** — Configure several keys per provider with sequential or round-robin rotation; reasoning effort is adjustable

### Development Environment

- **Built-in Terminal & Container** — A local Linux container built on Termux and PRoot with a built-in Alpine image; supports custom rootfs images and host directory mounts; multi-tab terminals that can stay alive in the background
- **Remote SSH Mode** — Use a remote SSH server as the execution backend: commands, files and terminal all act on the remote project
- **Shizuku backend** — With Shizuku, the AI can run shell and adb commands on the host Android system to debug or operate other devices (requires per-call approval)
- **File tree & code editor** — An indented file tree that opens files in a full-screen editor with syntax highlighting for mainstream languages and Markdown preview; `file:line` links in AI replies jump straight to that line, in both local and remote SSH workspaces
- **Git Integration** — Visual management of status, branches, commit history, diffs and tags, plus staging/discarding changes, sign-off and credentials
- **Workspace Sync** — SFTP / FTP synchronization with a built-in FTP server for desktop file management

### Experience

- **Tablet & large screen** — Layout adapts to window width: a persistent sidebar on wide screens with code or terminal beside the chat, falling back to a single pane when narrow
- **Token stats** — Usage and cost estimates per provider and model, with a drill-down into individual calls
- **Appearance & language** — Light/dark themes, preset color schemes, Material You colors, custom background images, and a bilingual (Chinese/English) UI
- **Network proxy** — Configure a global proxy and per-provider proxies separately
- **Backup & Restore** — Encrypted export/import of provider configs, credentials, chat history and workspace files
